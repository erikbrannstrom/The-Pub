Describe any modifications, assumptions and basic design decisions that have been made about the behavior of the various components of the simulation.

Identify all potential sources of deadlock in the problem specification and describe briefly how they are avoided in the implementation. Your documentation should include at least the following:

    Could the barmaid and landlord be involved in a deadlock when they take the ingredients for the cupboard? Why (not)?
    Could the barmaid and landlord be involved in a deadlock when they take the glasses and cups for the cupboard? Why (not)?

You should give an explanation of your implementation. If your code meets certain demands of readability (see below) an explanation of the tricky parts of the software suffices.
